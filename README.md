The game features the main window with a canvas and a control panel, as well as a simple Lexicon.  

In addition to the ability of modifying basic settings such as simulation speed, grid size, randomizing cell positions, 
clearing the canvas, drawing custom pattern, and accesing the lexicon, the control panel offers more in-depth customization; 
the user can toggle the visibility of a grid border, switch between light and dark themes, access the Lexicon, and adjust 
the fundamental rules governing overpopulation and survival. These adjustments allow the user to explore how different 
parameters influence the game's behavior.  

Figures from the Lexicon are automatically placed on the canvas when selected, making it easy to experiment with various patterns.
